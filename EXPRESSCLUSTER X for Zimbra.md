   - Press Y and enter to continue the system modification
   - Press N and Enter to cancel the notification of Zimbra installation
   - Press Enter to complete the configuration.


 ### NOTE - 
     
     - If you are doing Zimbra fresh Installation make sure you should be install Zimbra on mirror disk partition.
     
       - After Zimbra Installation you need to take backup of zimbra files as below steps.
  
       - Firstly stop the zimbra service on server. 

            systemctl stop zimbra
       - Switch to root user and run the following command

            ps aux | grep zimbra

       - If any of the Zimbra processes are running then 
         use kill command to end the processes

       - Create a new directory in /mnt directory 
         say zimbra_backup.

            rsync -axvzKHS  --progress /opt/zimbra 
            /mnt/zimbra_backup
	    
	    
  ### 2. Modifying the hosts file of both the servers. 

    - Open the terminal on the desktop and run the following command: 

            vi /etc/hosts

      - Create an entry for the IP address, Fully Qualified Domain Name of the Primary server. 

      - Save the hosts file and exit. 

      - Verify the DNS server IP and DNS search path in the NIC card settings run the following command: 

            nmtui


   ### 3. Zimbra Existing installation:
   
   ## On Primary server:-
  
  - "In this case Zimbra is installed in default disk and have to move data on the mirror partition".

 Steps :-
 
 - Firstly stop the zimbra service on server. 

            systemctl stop zimbra
	    
 - Switch to root user and run the following command.

            ps aux | grep zimbra

  - If any of the Zimbra processes are running then 
        use kill command to end the processes.

NOTE :-
 - The Zimbra backup data must be available before performing this activity.
 
 - After backup change the zimbra directory name.
          example :-
         /opt/zimbraold {New name of the Zimbra directory}
 
         
 - Run the following command to copy the existing Zimbra files to mirror disk location: 	 
	
	   rsync -axvzKHS --progress /opt/zimbraold/* /opt/zimbra
 
 - Run the bellow command to fix permission for all the files:
        
	   /opt/zimbra/libexec/zmfixperms  -e  -v

 - After the copy is successful, start the Zimbra services by running the following command to verify that the copy has been done successfully: 
         
	   systemctl start zimbra
 
-  After Checking the zimbra service status stop the zimbra service again.
	 
	   systemctl stop zimbra
	 
## Secondary server 

 - Stop Zimbra services.
 
 - After backup change the zimbra directory name.
          example :-
         /opt/zimbraolddr {New name of the Zimbra directory}
 
 
### In case of HA,  Modify the Hosts file on both servers

 - Stop the Zimbra service.
 
 - Bind the hostname with FIP in the hosts file.
  
   Example :-
  
   Server-1
   vi /etc/hosts 
   10.0.7.170     demo1.ecxvmcloud.com
  
   Server-2
   vi /etc/hosts 
   10.0.7.170     demo1.ecxvmcloud.com

 
 - Save the hosts file & exit. 
 
 - Start the Zimbra service & verify the Zimbra.
 
 ### In case of DR, Modify the Hosts file on both servers

 - Stop the Zimbra service.
 
 - Bind the machine local IP with DDNS name in the hosts file.
  
   Example :-
  
   Server-1
   vi /etc/hosts 
   10.0.7.166     demo1.ecxvmcloud.com
  
   Server-2
   vi /etc/hosts 
   10.0.7.167     demo1.ecxvmcloud.com

 
 - Save the hosts file & exit. 
 
 - Start the Zimbra service & verify the Zimbra.
   
       

2. EXPRESSCLUSTER setup  
    
    - Let us consider the following 2 node cluster and try to understand it.

    ### Cluster Information
    ||Node1(Active)|Node2(Stanby)|
    |---|---|---|
    |Server Name|Server1|Server2|
    |IPaddress|10.0.7.166|10.0.7.167|  
    |cluster partition|/dev/sdb1|/dev/sdb1|
    |data partition|/dev/sdc2|/dev/sdc2|
    
    ### Failover Group Information  
    |Parameter|Value|
    |---|---|
    |Name|Failover1|
    |Startup Server| Server1 -> Server2 |
    |Floating ip address|10.0.7.170|
    |Mirror disk resource (mount point))|/opt/zimbra|
    
    - In Config mode of the Cluster WebUI, add failover group to use Zimbra.  
      You need to add the following resources.
          - Floating ip resource  
          - Mirror disk resource
    
     - If you want to know how to add resource, please refer to [this site](https://github.com/EXPRESSCLUSTER/BasicCluster/blob/master/X41/Lin/2nodesMirror_Lin.md#how-to-setup-basic-2-nodes-mirror-cluster-on-linux) 
     
     - After you add failver group and execute apply the configuration file, you start failover group by server1. 

    ### Note  
- Execute the initial mirror construction 

   - Specify if an initial mirror configuration is constructed when constructing a cluster

   - When the check box is selected:
      An initial mirror configuration will be constructed. 
 
   - The time that takes to construct the initial mirror is different from ext2/ext3/ext4 and other file systems. 

   - When the check box is not selected: 
     An initial mirror configuration will not be constructed.

<img src="mirror_tuning.PNG")
</p>
	
- Execute initial mkfs

  - Specify if an initial mkfs is constructed when constructing a cluster. This option can be set only if the initial mirror is being         constructed. 

  - In the case of hybrid disk resources, the clphdinit command behavior is executed instead of initial mkfs behavior upon cluster construction

  - When the check box is selected:
    An initial mkfs will be run

  - When the check box is not selected: 
    An initial mkfs will not be run.


### Setup Zimbra Server cluster
#### On Primary Server
1. Add one exec resource to the failover group
	- failover group
		- exec
			- start.sh: Refer a [sample script](https://github.com/Anshuman-J/Zimbra-/blob/main/EXPRESSCLUSTER%20X%20for%20Zimbra.md#sample-scripts)
			- stop.sh:  Refer a [sample script](https://github.com/Anshuman-J/Zimbra-/blob/main/EXPRESSCLUSTER%20X%20for%20Zimbra.md#sample-scripts)
1. Apply the configuration
1. Start the exec resource


## Sample scripts
### start.sh
```bat
#! /bin/sh
#***************************************
#*              start.sh               *
#***************************************

#ulimit -s unlimited

systemctl start zimbra

exit $?
```
### stop.sh
```bat
#! /bin/sh
#***************************************
#*              start.sh               *
#***************************************

#ulimit -s unlimited

systemctl stop zimbra

exit $?
```
